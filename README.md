**Voice-Enabled User Interface for Geospatial Map-Based Web Applications**

This project integrates voice commands with geographic mapping functionalities, allowing users to interact with maps through spoken instructions. It leverages web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various APIs including Leaflet for mapping, OpenStreetMap for geospatial data, and OpenWeatherMap for weather information.

**Key Features**

•Voice Commands: Users can issue commands to navigate the map, view weather conditions, and find nearby points of interest.

•Map Navigation: Supports zooming in/out, moving the map left/right, and switching between different map layers (street, satellite, terrain).

•Weather Information: Fetches and displays current weather conditions for specified locations.

•Points of Interest (POI) Search: Finds and displays nearby POIs based on user queries.

**Getting Started**

**Prerequisites**

•A modern web browser supporting HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript ES6+.

•Internet connection for accessing online APIs and map services.

**Installation**

Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine. Ensure all files are correctly placed in the same directory.

**Usage**

1.Opening the Application: Navigate to the index.html file in your web browser.

2.Starting Voice Commands: Click the "Start Listening" button to begin issuing voice commands.

Example commands include "Navigate to [location]", "Show weather of [location]", "Move map left/right", "Switch to satellite/terrain/street layer".

3.Stopping Voice Commands: Click the "Stop Listening" button to stop processing voice commands.

**Technical Details**

**Frontend Technologies**

•HTML/CSS: Used for structuring and styling the web interface.

•JavaScript: The primary scripting language for implementing application logic, handling events, and interacting with APIs.

•Leaflet: An open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps.

•Web Speech API: Enables speech recognition and synthesis in web applications.

**Backend Services/APIs**

•OpenStreetMap: Provides geospatial data and map tiles used in the application.

•OpenWeatherMap: Offers weather data fetched based on user requests.
